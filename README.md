# piwigo-plugin-simplecopyright

This Piwigo plugin is meant to add a site-wide default license (between base footer and Perso Footer plugin's section) and to show copyright on picture page (between ```author``` and ```creation date fields```) but latest will default to picture's IPTC copyright if it exists. It is possible to choose beetween [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) licences (International version 4.0) or any other licence publicly available on internet (through ```Custom copyright``` setting) or no license at all (which means any picture with a correct Copyright is fully protected by Copyright law).

Note that after installation, plugin is set to ```No license``` by default as it seems better to provide higher protection untill user decides otherwise.
